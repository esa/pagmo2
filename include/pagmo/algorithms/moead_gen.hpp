/// Generational Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithms by Decomposition (the DE variant)
/**
 * \image html moead.png "Solving by decomposition" width=3cm
 *
 * Here the MOEA/D-DE algorithm is adapted into a version which only updates the population on a generational basis.
 * Rather than constructing a new candidate and evaluating its fitness one-by-one across the population, the new candidate population is created 
 * at once at the beginning of a generation, and then the fitness of each candidate is evaluated either in parallel with a bfe or in series.
 * While this sacrifices the immediate sensitivity of the original MOEA/D-DE to changes in the population, it does allow for easy parallelizability.
 * This variant can employ a bfe to make several fitness evaluations simultaneously, and should be used for expensive fitness functions.
