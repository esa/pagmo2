C++ Documentation
=================
The full, stand-alone, detailed, documentation of the c++ code.

Core classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the core PaGMO classes to learn how to use them
we suggest to follow the tutorials / examples.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  problem
  population
  algorithm

Implemented algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the algorithms implemented in PaGMO. They can be used
to solve problems you have implemented or to learn how to use PaGMO to
code your own algorithm

.. toctree::

  algorithms/de
  algorithms/de1220
  algorithms/moead
  algorithms/mbh
  algorithms/pso
  algorithms/sade
  algorithms/sea
  algorithms/simulated_annealing

Implemented problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the problems implemented in PaGMO. They can be used
to test your algorithms or to learn how to use PaGMO to represent your
problem
